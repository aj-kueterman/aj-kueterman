# AJ's LOGAC Scale

I like the idea of the [LOGAF scale](https://blog.danlew.net/2020/04/15/the-logaf-scale/), where we can easily indicate if suggestions to PR review or other feedback is given in 'levels of give-a-f*ck'. But to avoid the somewhat crude (tho somewhat endearing) naming scheme, let's refer to this measure as the LOGAC ("low-gak") scale - "levels of give-a-care" (or give-a-crap? whatever).

Either way, here are my PR templates for my scale. They each link back here. I'm going to start using these in PR's to indicate my LOGAC on PR comments.

## Low

A this level I usually just noticed something that had a slight code smell. I may spot things that are tangential to your change or just things I 'noticed' when reviewing. 

You can self-resolve these comments in GitHub without a comment.

```
[ðŸŸ¢ low](https://github.com/aj-kueterman/aj-kueterman/blob/main/aj-logaf-scale.md#low)
```

## Medium

At this level I feel changes should be made but can be convinced with a good reason, a follow up story/documentation/etc. that captures the changes in future work or clarification. 

You can self-resolve these comments in GitHub with a comment.

```
[ðŸŸ¡ medium](https://github.com/aj-kueterman/aj-kueterman/blob/main/aj-logaf-scale.md#medium)
```

## High

At this level I feel like changes need to be made before this PR is merged. In exceptional cases, follow up stories & documentation may resolve these concerns, but they would usually require a conversation with me or some other SME.

Do not self-resolve these comments in GitHub. Make changes / leave comments and allow me to resolve them before merging.
