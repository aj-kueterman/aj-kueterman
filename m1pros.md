# What MacBook to Buy for Android Development?
Now that there are new, M1-series MacBook Pros, a lot of developers may be looking to finally upgrade from their Intel-based MacBooks.

Considering the memory and GPU considerations of Android development, the configuration I would suggest would be either:

## Perfect World
These configurations bump up GPU performance and add Memory, both which would make things run even smoother for Android dev, but are probably overkill for now. If anything, this just guarantees a longer effective lifetime of these machines, so depending on what the usual active lifetime of our MacBooks are you may or may not want to invest the extra $600 per machine.

### 14" MacBook Pro
* Apple M1 Max with 10-core CPU, 24-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
* 64GB unified memory
* 1TB SSD storage
* **$3,499.00**

### 16" MacBook Pro
* Apple M1 Max with 10-core CPU, 24-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine
* 64GB unified memory
* 1TB SSD storage
* **$3,699.00**

Gabriel Peal, a GDE and former Google engineer [recommends this 14" configuration](https://gpeal.medium.com/the-m1-pro-for-android-engineers-a144093aa1ec) and I included the respective 16" configuration as well.

I think this hits the sweet spot of performance / cost. 32 GB is a memory minimum at this point for Android Dev, but should give enough headroom to fly for the next few years at least. The 10 core Pro CPU will make a difference over the 8 core Pro for Gradle builds, and the 16 core GPU over the 14 will do the same for Android Emulator performance.
