title: PR Comment Severity Scale
description: My custom 'LOGAF' scale for PR's.

Based on Dan Lew's [LOGAF Scale](https://blog.danlew.net/2020/04/15/the-logaf-scale/), this is a quick reference for my PR comments.

---

## Low

A this level I usually just noticed something that had a slight code smell. I may spot things that are tangential to your change or just things I 'noticed' when reviewing. 

**You can self-resolve these comments in GitHub without a comment.**

```
[ðŸŸ¢ low](https://aj-kueterman.github.io/aj-kueterman/logaf#low)
```

## Medium

At this level I feel changes should be made but can be convinced with a good reason, a follow up story/documentation/etc. that captures the changes in future work, or clarification. 

**You can self-resolve these comments in GitHub with a comment.**

```
[ðŸŸ¡ medium](https://aj-kueterman.github.io/aj-kueterman/logaf#medium)
```

## High

At this level I feel like changes need to be made before this PR is merged. In exceptional cases, follow up stories & documentation may resolve these concerns, but they would usually require a conversation with me or some other SME.

**Do not self-resolve these comments in GitHub. Make changes / leave comments and allow me to resolve them before merging.**

```
[ðŸ”´ high](https://aj-kueterman.github.io/aj-kueterman/logaf#high)
```
