Just a quick overview of how I think about point sizing.

|Size|Reasoning|
|:---:|:---|
|0|I did this while we were talking
|1|I could do this in my sleep
|2|I know exactly how to do this
|3|I may have to think about how best to do this, and may have questions to figure out how
|5|I need to write some custom or complex code, iterate, and ask questions & maye do some additional investigation / research to accomplish this
|8|I may need to make a POC, consult experts, or do other exploration before coming to a good solution - which will be complex to design & code

Anything beyond 8 is not a story.

But really, the main thing is that you're using story points to compare things. If everything is a 3 it's meaningless. If we start pointing without comparing stories, then we are tilting into time estimation which is not what we want. That's the only reason I would push back on making a story a 3 when I think it should be a 2 - usually it's because I think we've done equal to or harder work as 2pt stories in the past.
